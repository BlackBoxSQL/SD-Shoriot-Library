* Ubuntu 16.04
* Git 
* PostgreSQL
* NGINX
* Supervisor
* Gunicorn

1. Go to: [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) then Sing Up & Login

2. Create a New Droplet
Like: Pick the Ubuntu 16.04.1 distribution:

3. Select the size of the Droplet (cloud server):
Like: $ 5/month or $ 10/month

4. Select the region you want to deploy:
Like: New York or London

5. Finally pick a name for the Droplet & click on Create. After that you will see the recently created droplet in your profile:

6. You will receive the root password via email. Now pick the IP Address and ssh into the server:

ssh root@107.170.28.172

You will be asked to change the root password upon the first login.

Also if you prefer, you can use the Digital Ocean’s console:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```
