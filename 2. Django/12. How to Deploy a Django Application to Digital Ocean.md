#### or you can try it.

###### DigitalOcean is a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider. In this tutorial I will guide you through the steps I go to deploy a Django application using 
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Git 
* PostgreSQL
* NGINX
* Supervisor
* Gunicorn

1. Go to: [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) then Sing Up & Login

2. Create a New Droplet:
```python
Pick the Ubuntu 16.04.1 distribution:
```
3. Select the size of the Droplet (cloud server):
```python
Like: $ 5/month or $ 10/month
```
4. Select the region you want to deploy:
```python
Like: New York or London
```
5. Finally pick a name for the Droplet & click on Create. After that you will see the recently created droplet in your profile:

6. You will receive the root password via email. Now pick the IP Address and ssh into the server:
```python
$ ssh root@107.170.28.172
```
* You will be asked to change the root password upon the first login.

* Also if you prefer, you can use the Digital Ocean’s console:

7. Installing the Server Dependencies

* First thing let’s upgrade the packages:
```python
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```
8. PostgreSQL

* Install the dependencies to use PostgreSQL with Python/Django:
```python
$ sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libpq-dev python-dev
```
* Install the PostgreSQL Server:
```python
$ sudo apt-get -y install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

9. NGINX

* Install NGINX, which will be used to serve static assets (css, js, images) and also to run the Django application behind a proxy server:
```python
$ sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

10. Supervisor

* Supervisor will start the application server and manage it in case of server crash or restart:
```python
$ sudo apt-get -y install supervisor
```
* Enable and start the Supervisor:
```python
$ sudo systemctl enable supervisor

$ sudo systemctl start supervisor
```
